# pyphotonics

PyPhotonics is a post-processing python code that calculates photonic properties of materials. Based on the outcome of DFT, constrained DFT and vibrational calculations using DFT performed using VASP for a defect system, PyPhotonics uses the results in the output files and calculates the Huang-Rhys factor of the defect and the photoluminescence line-shape. Soon, the code will calculate the carrier capture coefficient and carrier lifetimes for defects, which are essential quantities for assessing the photovoltaic efficiency of materials.
